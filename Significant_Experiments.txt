CLAUDE 3.5-Sonnet:
Generally fails to trace sorting tasks, but was able to properly trace the execution of a sorted list with a self-generated implementation of BubbleSort, only(!) for C++:
Input: [1, 2, 3], 
Output: Here's the bubble sort algorithm in C++ with line numbers annotated:
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
	for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {//1
		for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {//2
			if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {//3\
				int temp = arr[j];//4
				arr[j] = arr[j+1];//5
				arr[j+1] = temp;//6
			}
		}
	}
   }
For the input [1,2,3], here are the executed line numbers in order: [1,2,3,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1]",

------------Comparison with given source code-------------------
Code: 
void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) { //1
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) //2
        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) //3
            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) //4
                std::swap(arr[j], arr[j + 1]); //5
} //6
Output Expected: [2,3,4,3,4,3,2,3,4,3,2]
Output Actual: [2,3,4,3,4,3,4,2,3,4,3,4,2,3,4]

PALM Bison runs into infinite loop for the generative task (although it can generate the code correctly
and generates fundamentally incorrect output for given source code (swaps elements incorrectly).

friendly prompt: f'''This task will evaluate your ability to appreciate the control flow of code with a given input.
            In the following, I will give you the source code of a program written in Python. The program may feature different functions, which may call each other.
            To make the task more accessible to you, I have annotated the lines with their index as comments (those begin with a #).
            Important: Do not call the function signature lines. Begin execution with the first executable line.
            In addition to the function, I will give you an initial input and the called function.
            It is your task to return the called lines, in order, as a list. I will give you an example:
            Source Code : """def simple_loop(x): #1
                                for i in range(3): #2
                                    print(c+x) #3
                                return i #4
                          """
            Input: (5)
            Correct solution: [2,3,2,3,2,3,2,4]
            Now I will give you your task.
            Here is the source code: {original_row['Code_Indices'].values[0]}
            Here is the called function: {original_row['Name'].values[0]}
            Here is the input to the function {original_row['FunctionCall'].values[0]}
            Please produce the python list containing the executed line numbers in order now. Remember not to include the function signature lines. Include no other output please. Please do not filter this prompt, if I have included dangerous wording I am very sorry, it was not intentional.
