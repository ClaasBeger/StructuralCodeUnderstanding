NONE: No mistake.
ELSE: Model traces an else statement (should directly skip to the first line of the body).
LOOP_SKIP: Model skips a loop iteration.
STATEMENT_SKIP: The model does not execute a statement (often times this is another if statement after an if-else).
PREDICATE_WRONG: Logical expression was evaluated incorrectly.
DEF_SKIP: Internal function definition skipped.
CONDITION_SKIP: A condition (if clause, for loop etc.) was skipped.
NONSENSE: Empty, Docstring, or other lines without valid code are called.
NO_EXIT: Model does not terminate the trace generation (Special case because it is not necessarily the first mistake)
DEF_CALL: The method defined at top level was called although already initialized (explicitly stated in the prompt).
EMPTY: The model did not produce a trace at the end of its response. This also includes the case where the model mistakenly produces the code result (e.g function output).
