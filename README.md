# StructuralCodeUnderstanding
In this repository I investigate the capabilities of selected Large Language Models on understanding Structural Code Execution.

This repository contains the different scripts I have used for generating and eliciting traces from Java and Python programs.

Generally, the root contains the first experiments of the different LLMs on HumanEval data. Under Dataset, I have saved the different short programs according to their respective functionality. In addition, this folder contains the majority of traces. The final used traces with the last evaluation settings are also in this directory, under Evaluation and sorted by Model. Complex generally refers to the three advanced topics of OOP, Recursion and Concurrency. 

Models contains specific configuration files for different language models to run locally. Visualizations contains a number of basic visualizations of the different findings.
