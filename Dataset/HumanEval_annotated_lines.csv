    the last couple centuries. However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.  # e
    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:  # f
    tri(1) = 3  # g
    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.  # h
    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.  # i
    For example:  # j
    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2  # k
    tri(4) = 3  # l
    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)  # m
           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8   # n
    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the   # o
    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.  # p
    Examples:  # q
    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]  # r
    """"""  # s
